### Identity verification testing
Additional services required to test IV uplift: KEYSTORE, PLATFORM_ANALYTICS, IV_CALLVALIDATE_PROXY, IV_TEST_DATA, IDENTITY_VERIFICATION_FRONTEND

Relevant application.conf field: urls.iv-uplift-entry

Manual testing might require disabling CORS on identity_verification_frontend repository, this was the case during writing this.

Add the following to application.conf of identity_verification_frontend:
```play.filters.disabled += play.filters.csrf.CSRFFilter```

Eventually we might want to move to iv-stubs, but currently they don't support organisations. identity_verification_stub repository.
